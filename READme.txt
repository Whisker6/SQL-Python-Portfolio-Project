Spotify Database

Overall, this portfolio project was troublesome. The database creation, design, alterations were the smoothest part. Comparatively speaking, the Python course portfolio project was way more fun and engaging.

Implementing REST API was a nightmare. I tried for hours to get one working and ultimately decided not to include it. I did not feel informed enough after Week 3 to make that a reality in the project. I don't think the course material did a great job teaching us how to actually implement a REST API from the ground up as 80% or more of the code was written for us that week. Very frustrating and that was reflected in my Week 3 review of the course material.

I still don't really understand SQLAlchemy, Flask, etc. and how it all works together. I'll need to go do supplemental learning that will actually walk me through WHY we're writing certain code and not writing it for me.

Migrations:
By the time we had learned about migrations, I already had my database built out. I didn't see the point in creating migrations and it would seem like backtracking at that point.
